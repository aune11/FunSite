I had never heard of Jekyll before starting this dummy site, so this is mainly for me to learn and try out some of Jekyll's capabilities.  Liking it so far, definitely going to keep learning what I can of it and how to apply it in real life.

Also, flexbox is awesome.  I somehow haven't heard of it until now, but after toying with it some, it's definitely going to be my new favorite CSS trick, even if it does take a couple tries to get right.

Colors are a mess on this project, mainly because I wanted stuff to stand out from each other as I was adding and changing things.  I do like the darker blue/orange theme though, I'll have to use it on a future project (one that looks pleasing to the eye and is worthy of going live with).
